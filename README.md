The purpose of this collection of R scripts is to act as a template for others who want to make similar graphs and want to save time or learn from already completed code by using a template.

The scripts are split into different projects that visualize data for different purposes. As the scripts are added, a description will be added to this readme.

Each project will include a main version of the script and several additional versions for special cases.

An example of a special case would be adding a loop to create several seperate graphs to enable visualization of large datasets with many treatments and/or with output from many models (such as for initial data analysis in model comparison projects).

Each project will also include sample datasets to better understand the expected data structure.

Planned projects:
x. Time series graphs for daily data spanning across years using DOY, without creating a temporally disjointed graph [in progress]
x. Soil moisture (SM) series graphs- useful for visualization and data validation of SM data (comparing values to a user set field capacity, saturation, and permanent wilting point (PWP)) [in progress]
x. Visualization of missing data in a dataset [in progress]
x. Visualization of model-ensemble results: visualizing full range as shading in the graph around an ensemble-median value [in progress]
